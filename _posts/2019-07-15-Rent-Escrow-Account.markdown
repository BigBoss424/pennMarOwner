<h1>The Rent Escrow Accout Program <strong>REAP</strong></h1>
The Rent Escrow Account Program (REAP) exists to resolve the most persistent health and safety and habitability issues found in rental properties in the City. In addressing these issues REAP helps reduce blight, protects tenants from substandard housing, and helps preserve the Cityâ€™s valuable affordable housing stock.

REAP encourages owners to make the repairs and return the property to a safe and habitable condition. Tenants of affected units are given a 10% to 50% rent reduction depending on the nature and severity of the violations cited. Tenants have the option to pay their reduced rents to the landlord or into an escrow account managed by the Department.

Rents deposited into the escrow account are then made available to the landlord, tenants, or other interested parties through an application process. If eligible, you may request funds from the escrow account to make repairs, pay utilities, or for relocation to a new apartment.
